            The only thing that you have to do is to buy tokens, then launch the
            app to buy your first Meta Farm by clicking
            <a
              class="link-here"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://metafarms.finance"

            Each kind of Farm generates different levels of rewards due to the
            size and how it can be upgraded in the future. Currently, there are
            five kinds of Farms :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>- Chicken Farm</li>
            <li>- Pig Farm</li>
            <li>- Fish Farm</li>
            <li>- Cow Farm</li>
            <li>- Horse Farm</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This means that you will be able to take advantage of a large
            variety of yield-generating protocols, without having to find the
            best ones yourself and conduct due-diligence, and without having to
            pay for the fees of each platform.

            All the in-game assets are distributed this way:
            <br>
            70% are moved to the reward pool
            <br>
            10% tokens to the liquidity pool
            <br>
            (5% tokens are converted in BNB)
            <br>
            and 20% are moved to the research &amp; development/growth wallet.

            Meta Farms uses a reward protocol based on Axie Infinity and Olympus
            DAO.<br><br>The in-game activity fees are used to fill the
            reward pool of the game. But, as weâ€™re seeking long-term
            sustainability, we are using the concept of Game Theory used by
            Olympus DAO.<br><br>The goal is to make the long-term and
            reinvesting strategy the most efficient way for everybody to earn
            high yields from Meta Farms.

          <p>
            To promote the purchase of Farms and to develop the long-term vision
            of the project, a 10% fee is applied ONLY when selling $MEAT. You
            can claim and buy new Farms without any fees.
